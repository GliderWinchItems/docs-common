1. Setup RPi from the following video--
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpJCAafw2qE

2. cansetup file in ~/linux-can initializes the CAN0 and CAN1 interfaces.

3. CAN0 and CAN1 should show in the following--
ifconfig -a 

4. MCP hardware oriented

5. Temperature/thermal--DO NOT FORGET 'sudo'

wellsca@cb0:~$ sudo /opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp
temp=51.6'C
wellsca@cb0:~$ 

6. Other commands

7. Seeed hw RTC

wellsca@cb0:~$ sudo hwclock --verbose
hwclock from util-linux 2.33.1
System Time: 1624499925.638066
Trying to open: /dev/rtc0
Using the rtc interface to the clock.
Assuming hardware clock is kept in UTC time.
Waiting for clock tick...
ioctl(4, RTC_UIE_ON, 0): Invalid argument
Waiting in loop for time from /dev/rtc0 to change
...got clock tick
Time read from Hardware Clock: 2021/06/24 01:58:47
Hw clock time : 2021/06/24 01:58:47 = 1624499927 seconds since 1969
Time since last adjustment is 1624499927 seconds
Calculated Hardware Clock drift is 0.000000 seconds

 Load CAN-bus (seeed stuff)
  [rpi] echo >>/boot/config.txt 'dtoverlay=seeed-can-fd-hat-v2'
  [rpi] reboot
  [rpi] ip link show
  [rpi] ifconfig -a
  [rpi] sudo apt install can-utils
  [rpi-X] sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
  [rpi-X] sudo ip link set can1 type can bitrate 500000
  [rpi-X] sudo ip link set up can0
  [rpi-X] sudo ip link set up can1
  [rpi-1] candump can0
  [rpi-0] cansend can0 123#1122334455667788

  9. .ssh needs a config file for github ssh usage

  https://blog.realhe.ro/clone-github-repo-without-password-using-ssh/

  Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github

10. linux-can repo: can-tests

Needs #include <linux/sockios.h> added to each .c file

11.Two items wrt hub-server:

0. We should be using version 9, not version 10_PRELEASE.

1. we should be starting it something like this:

   sudo nohup nice -n -15 hub-server $OTHER_ARGS 1>hub-server.out 2>hub_server.err &

12. CAN write buffer length setup

  sudo ifconfig can1 txqueuelen 1024; ./tst-raw -i can1 -s

13. Seeed driver enable

- MCP2518 driver is apparently already in kernel

a) Enable driver
   In /boot directory config.txt file append the following line--
dtoverlay=seeed-can-fd-hat-v2

b) In the file uncomment these two lines--

dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=spi=on

The first enables I2C for the Seeed RTC.
The second enables SPI for Seeed CAN MCP2518.

NOTE: Changes to /boot can be done by plugging the RPi SD card
into a PC. The /boot will mount and can be modified with a
conventional editor.

14. Initializing CAN intefaces

In the file /etc/rc.local append--

ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
ip link set can1 type can bitrate 500000
ip link set up can0
ip link set up can1

15. See rc.local in this repo
