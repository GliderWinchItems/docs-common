Portforwarding CAN bus
02-14-2014
================================================================================================  
The following gives the steps for setting up portforwarding of the netbook server
that is connected via a Discovery F4 gateway to a test CAN bus.  The forwarded
port can be connected to by (multiple) local programs.

The local connections are made to 'localhost' (127.0.0.1) and port 32123.

The scheme uses ssh for a secure connection to an account on a netbook running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
The account is /home/hub-server and it is setup to only connect with the forwarded port, and as
such there is no access beyond the hub-server connection.

The netbook is connected to a 'gateway' that passes CAN messages to/from the netbook.  The CAN bus
is connected to some units that send test messages and readings.
=================================================================================================
LINUX  

1. Generate RSA keys

The netbook requires a RSA key to complete a login.  'ssh' listens on port 41576 of my internet
IP address (currently, 02/26/2014, 72.64.251.177).

If you have the private key file that goes with the public key file in the netbook, then copy
that file to ~/.ssh/, or if there isn't a .ssh directory make one as shown below.

In your home directory add a directory .ssh if not present.
  ls -la ~ [display directories and files, including hidden directories, in home directory]
  mkdir .ssh [add directory if not present]
  cd .ssh
  ssh-keygen [generate pair of ssh keys]


2. Send public key to be placed in the netbook, unless using the public key.

email address: dhaselwood@verizon.net

I add the public key to 'authorized_keys' file in /home/hub-server/.ssh of the netbook.

In the case of being given the private key, the public key is already in the
authorized_keys file on netbook in the hub-server account.

3. Log in to the netbook

In a terminal window #1 with the following command-- 

  ssh -T -L32123:127.0.0.1:32123 -p 41576 hub-server@72.64.251.177

Note:
1) There is no response when it logs in.
   A simple way to know that the connection has been made and the port has been forwarded
   is to execute a program the connects to the port (see step 4 below).

2) The IP address may change, i.e. 72.64.251.177 is currently assigned by Verizon
   and is always subject to change.

   Also the netbook server is sometimes taken down for updating, etc.  I try to keep
   it up with the hub-server|socat|gateway running live on the CAN bus.
   
   Email me if you cannot connect.  A Skype session is often faster way to resolve an issue
   than bouncing emails back and forth.

4. Connect to the local socket with programs

Once connected, port 32123 appears as a local socket on your machine.  Open additional terminal window to
start each local program, for example all of the following can be run, all at the same time
if so desired-- 

  telnet localhost 32123 
Displays stream of incoming CAN msgs.
Use ctl ] to stop.

  nc localhost 32123
Same as telnet, use ctl C to quit.

If you don't have 'nc' ("netcat")--
  sudo apt-get install netcat

./cangate 127.0.0.1 32123
Found in directory--
  ~/svn_discoveryf4/PC/sensor/cangate/trunk
Provides a summary monitoring of incoming CAN msgs.

./cangate 127.0.0.1 32123 ~/svn_discoveryf4/PC/sensor/cangate/test/testmsg1.txt
Adding file spec allows 's' command to send CAN msgs from the .txt file.

Additionally, Java programs could connect to localhost 32123.

5. Closing the connection--

Ctl C to kill window #1 drops the connection.

=================================================================================================
WINDOWS

Note: this has only been tested on XP, and Vista.

1. Install the PuTTY package

http://www.putty.org/

2. Generate RSA keys (unless you want to use the *private* key supplied)

If the *private* key has been supplied copy it to a location where it can be accessed later.  The
private key extension is '.ppk'.

Run 'PuTTYgen'
Click "Generate" to start key generation.  Movement of the cursor is used to generate random
input.

When it is done with the generation--
- Save the *private* key without passphrase, i.e. "Yes" to skip entering a passphrase.
  Save it in a file where you know where it is located as you will need the path/name later.
- Export *public* key
  "Conversions" tab: 'Export OpenSSH key'
	Save without passphrase
  OR the preferred way,
  Copy/paste the entire window that shows the public key, pasting it into 'Notepad' and
     saving as a file

3.  Email the public key file to dhaselwood@verizon.net

  The public key along with some prepended commands is added to the netbook in '/home/hub-server/authorized_keys' file.

  At this point one should be able to ssh into the netbook, however there is no shell and there will
  be no response.

4.1  Configure PuTTY to ssh with port forwarding using PuTTY GUI--

Launch PuTTY.  It opens a window--at top says: "PuTTY Configuration"

In "Host name (or IP address)"
hub-server@72.64.251.177

In "Port"
41576

In "Connection Type" select radio button--
SSH

In "Saved sessions"
netbook_port [or whatever name you wish]

Click "Save" (so you you don't have to redo the above)

On left column ("Category") select '+' on SSH to open list
Click on "Auth"

In "Private Key file for authentication", click "Browse"
and select the file with private key (.ppk), saved earlier.

In "Category:Connection:SSH:TTY" "Remote Terminal Settings"
Check - "Don't allocate a pseudo-terminal"

In "Category:Connection:SSH:Tunnels"
Under "Add new forwarded port"
In "Source Port"
32123

In "Destination"
127.0.0.1:32123

Click "Add" it should appear in the box
L32123 127.0.0.1:32123

This command connects to port 32123 on the netbook, and creates a port
on the local machine (127.0.0.1) port 32123.  Programs on the local machine
connect to the port exactly the same if the program were run on netbook.

IMPORTANT--
Go back to "Category:Session" (top most) and click "SAVE".  If you click "OPEN"
it will start the session, but settings will be lost and have to be re-entered.

When PuTTY is started again, selecting the name and LOAD will retrieve the settings.
  Double clicking on the name will do a LOAD and OPEN, thereby starting the ssh port
  forwarding connection with just a double click.

4.2 Setting port forwarding using a command line

Setting up a .BAT file along with a desktop icon is another way to start a port forwarding
session.

- Get a "DOS" command window--
  "Start", in the "Start Search" box enter, command.com<enter>
  This should bring up a black "DOS window"

The following command line can be used to start the ssh port forwaring.  This can be put into a 
.BAT file, and by dragging it to the desktop an icon is generated which will  start up the ssh 
port forward connection.

The following is an example.  The quotes must be included.

"C:\Program Files\PuTTY\putty.exe" -i "C:\Program Files\PuTTY\id_rsa.ppk" -N -x -T -L 32123:127.0.0.1:32123 -l hub-server -P 41576 72.64.251.177

The path/name in the first "..." launches PuTTY.

Don't forget the '-i' 

The second "..." is the path/name for finding the *private* key (.ppk) associated with the public key that is the 
companion to the public key installed in the netbook authorized_keys file.

The 32123:127.0.0.1:32123 is ssh the port being forwarded from the netbook and the port that is
setup locally.

'-l hubserver' is the account name for the netbook login

'-P 41576' is the netbook ssh port number

'72.64.251.177' is the ip address, which Verizon changes occasionally.

When the above command line executes successfully connects you should see a box open with--

Using username "hub-server".
Auathenticating with public key "rsa...." from agent

If there is problem with keys, there will be a message that it failed.

There are a number of reaons the netbook might not connect--
- Verizon changed the ip address
- The netbook is down (and/or long term power outage)
- The key is not in authorized_key file correctly.

Once 'ssh'd into the netbook, CAN msgs will pass to/from the netbook-gateway-CAN bus units.

Note: the CAN msgs are "lines" that terminate with '\n'.  


5. Run programs that connect to the local port--

A PuTTY telnet session can be used to display the CAN msgs.  Note that the connection to
the hub-server must be made first, otherwise the PuTTY telnet session will not have a port
to connect to.

Start PuTTY

With the "Sessions" (left column) selected, under "Basic options for your PuTTY session"
 under "Host Name (or IP address) 'localhost'
 in "Port" 32123

"Connection type"
  Telnet radio button

"Saved Sessions"
 use "Default Settings" or give it a name such as 'telnet'

Select "Terminal" (at left column)
  Check "Implicit CR in every LF"

Go back to "Sessions" and "Save".  When PuTTY is launched the settings can be retrieved with "Load".

"Open" should connect to the 'localhost:32123' and the stream presented.

Multiple instances of PuTTY or any other program connecting to the local socket can be run.  If too many streams
are connected the streams become "jerky" with pauses, but we have not experienced any loss of data.  The netbook
hub-server is set to limit to 20 connections and at 20 it is beginning to bog down.  There are also delays in the
internet depending on the path and loading.

6. ssh 

'-W' switch with ssh acts as a "netcat"--

 ssh -p 41577 deh@72.64.251.177 -W 10.1.1.80:32123

ssh into Toshiba, -W connects, to 10.1.1.80:32123 as if 'nc 10.1.1.80 32123' (which is the netbook local network 
address and port) was executed on the Toshiba.

7. ssh multi-hop

ssh deh@72.64.251.177 -p 41577 -A [connects to Toshiba]
And once in the Toshiba--
ssh deh@72.64.251.177 -p 41576 -A [connects to netbook]

This does the same thing--
ssh -oproxycommand="ssh -p 41577 deh@72.64.251.177 nc %h %p" -p 41576 deh@72.64.251.177
