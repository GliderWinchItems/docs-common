tunnel-tie-two-CAN-bus.txt
04/04/2024

Purpose: Connect two CAN buses via ssh. One CAN
bus connects to RPi41-deh in the usual manner.

Which is: hub-server w socat is started:
  hub-server-socat_b 32123 /dev/ttyUSB0 2000000
Where: "standard" port 32123
Only one serial device on the RPi
Serial speed: 2000000

RPi41-deh can be accessed from the outside:
deh IP (04/04/2024) is 47.204.211.51
Forward ports:
41571 RPi41-deh (RPi 4)
41572 RPi31-deh (Rpi 3)
41573 netbk2 (ACER netbook)
41574 netbk (ACER netbook)
41575 RPi11-deh (RPi zero W)


netbook and RPi41-deh has ssh keys that allow reverse
ssh'ing, to give a terminal window on the netbook.
Those keys are probably needed for the following.

1. Start hub-server/socat on RPi41-deh
-ssh into RPi41-deh
  ssh deh@47.204.211.51 -p 41571
  hub-server localhost 32126 localhost 32123 &
Where: 
32123 has the hub-server with the serial port
32126 will be forwarded  

In case there are problems shutting down this hub-server
will not stop the serial port on the 32123 server.


2. On netbook (the remote computer)
- Start the tunnel
   ssh -L 22226:localhost:32126 47.204.211.51 -p 41571
That ends up with a prompt logged in to the RP41
Leave that terminal window open.

- In another netbook terminal start a local hub-server
hub-server localhost 22226 &

- Test that the hub-server sees the data stream from 
RPi41-deh
  nc localhost 22226 [data stream appears]

  3. Adding another computer (ASUS)
  - Start tunnel
    deh@ASUS:~$ ssh -L 22229:localhost:32126 deh@$FITIP -p 41571

  - Open terminal and start local hub-server
    deh@ASUS:~$ hub-server localhost 22227 localhost 22229
    Either leave terminal open, or append & to above command

  - Open termianl and check that it works
    nc localhost 22227

   Note: hub-server port 32126 in the above, on the RPi, connects
   all that set up the '-L' port forward.
