The CAN loader occupies the first 0x5000 of flash.
The "app" loads at 0x5000.

To flash the CAN loader

1. Flash the CAN loader

cd ~/GliderWinchItems/CANloader1

./mm <CAN id>, e.g.
./mm B0E00000

2. Make a label and attach!

E.g. a small label "B0E0"

3. Trouble-shooting

Under some conditions if the first block is erased the
reset will jump to the internal L431 loader. 

To get out of this mode the loader program must be 
flashed, however it won't jump the loader program unless
power is cycled--
- remove power and CAN
- restore power
