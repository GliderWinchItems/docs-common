Howto-start_stop-selfchdischarge_low-current-charge
07/06/2024

Turn BMS mode ON/OFF of self-discharge (relaxation)|charge
(balancing). 

Normally, the mode is automatic, but one may want to terminate
a self-discharge and charge/balance. 

Or, if charging/balancing mode is in progress, terminate and
go into self-discharge mode. This might occur when the CAN 
power is off and battery ribbon have been pulled/reinserted
(which would drop the SRAM saving the status), with the
result that the program would start in thecharge/balancing
mode.

1. cangateBMS terminal

e.g. computer wifi on local network 192.168.2.xxx
This opens to Raspberry Pi4 with CAN hat
cangateBMS 192.168.2.100 32124

2. cangateBMS menu

Check BMS CAN id and Polling CAN id
'e'
E.g. (07/06/2024 defaults )
BMS  B0A00000 (default BMS unit)
Poll AEC00000 (default PC polls battery string 1)

Set CAN id for single unit of interest
'ew B0E00000'
Or, select ALL units (CAN id = 0)
'ew 00000000'

Check duration between poll msgs
'e'

Set poll duration (zero = no poll), e.g. every second
'ed 1000'

Set command to send to unit of interest 
(m = send to unit of interest only, k = set (not read))
'emk' 
Or, (a = all)
'eak'

Menu displays, select specific action
enter '31' for "31 SET_SELFDCHG"
Menu displays to select ON|OFF
enter '0' To stop self-discharge, begin charge
enter '1' To stop charge, begin self-discharge

Red led on unit should come on unless alreay charged.

Stop polling
'x'

Or, ctl C to kill cangateBMS
