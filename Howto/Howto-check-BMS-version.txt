Version is identified by CRC and CHECKSUM that is generated
and stored when the BMS program is compile and prepared for
flashing. 

CRC and CHECKSUM are stored at the end of the program. Each
can be retrieved with a CAN msg command.

1. First step is to retrieve the CRC and CHECKSUM from BMS nodes

'cangateBMS', command 'vb' polls all BMS nodes on the CAN bus
and retrieves the CRC and CHKSUM. 

The two polling CAN msgs are sent, followed by a 2 second
delay for the responses. Before the next poll is sent the
accumulated table is displayed.

'x' stops the polling.

2. Second step is to compare the retrieved CRC and CHECKSUM
with stored values.

When the BMS 'cc' or 'mm' commands are executed the compiling
and preparation for flashing stores the new CRC and CHECKSUM
in the params directory as
<BMS node CAN id>-crcchk.txt, e.g. 
./mm B0A00000 
would store--
B0A00000-crcchk.txt

NOTE: The .txt files are not part of the repo, and therefore
they are specific to the machine.

Running 'cangateBMS' 'vc' compares a previous running of 'vb'
to the saved values in the params directory. 

Note: the results of 'vb' remain in "common" until cangateBMS
is restarted. Running 'vc' before a 'vb' has been run results 
a message to run 'vb' first.
